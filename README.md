[A dictionary of English words to British Sign Language](dictionary.md).

This dictionary lists English words and contains timestamped links to videos
which are mostly on YouTube. This project is an index to these timestamps only;
the credit for the videos themselves should of course go to their creators.

Where I've found more than one ways to sign something I've put both words under the same bullet point like this:

 - [chicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C16Dpwdg0Kk&t=133s) [chicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkUSXiNU66s&t=495s)

Sometimes a word is used in a specific sense, in which case it's listed under the word it's used with, like this:

 - [food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C16Dpwdg0Kk&t=45s). ([delivery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C16Dpwdg0Kk&t=327s), [take away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C16Dpwdg0Kk&t=335s))

You can take that entry to mean something like "I've found that this word for delivery is used about food, don't trust that it makes sense when talking about what goes on in a labour ward".

If there's a reasonable way to describe the sign, then sometimes I put the description to save you a click:

 - [Birmingham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkUSXiNU66s&t=894s) (Or, fingerspell BBH)
